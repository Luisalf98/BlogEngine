# Blog Engine

Open and run the project with visual studio (I used Visual Studio Community 2019). The project was developed under .Net 5.

## Testing the solution
* This [Postman Collection](BlogEngine.postman_collection.json) can be used to test the API.

* In the [BlogEngineTest](BlogEngineTest) folder there are some unit tests of the project.

* Test Users:

    * **Username:** WRITER, **password:** password123, **ROLE:** WRITER
    * **Username:** EDITOR, **password:** password123, **ROLE:** EDITOR
    * **Username:** PUBLIC, **password:** password123, **ROLE:** PUBLIC
